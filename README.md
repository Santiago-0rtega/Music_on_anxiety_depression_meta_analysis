This repository hosts the data and analytical workflow for a systematic review and multilevel meta-analysis of music exposure effects on anxiety- and depression-like behavior in rodents.

In the `data/` folder:
- `extraction_mm_251105.xlsx` contains the full data extraction, coding metadata, and complete extracted dataset.
- `db251124.csv` contains the cleaned database used for effect size estimation.
- `db_effect_sizes.csv` contains the processed database with the three calculated effect sizes used in the analyses.

In the `book/` folder, all analytical code is provided and organized into multiple Quarto (`.qmd`) files corresponding to different parts of the workflow.
