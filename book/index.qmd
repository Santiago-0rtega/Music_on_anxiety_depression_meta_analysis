# What this site contains

This online supplement provides the complete computational workflow for the systematic review and multilevel meta-analysis of music exposure effects on anxiety- and depression-like behaviour in laboratory rodents.

It includes:

- Full data processing and effect-size derivations (lnRR, lnVR, and lnCVR), including safeguards for boundary values and audit checks

- Multilevel model specifications (VCV construction, random-effects structure) and overall-effect models for each effect size

- Uni-moderator meta-regressions across study and design characteristics, with post-hoc contrasts where applicable

- Publication-bias diagnostics and leave-one-out sensitivity analyses

- Figures and downloadable tables generated directly from the analysis pipeline

## How to navigate

Use the left sidebar to browse the workflow chapters:

- **Home** (index.qmd)

- **Effect size calculation** (`effect_size_calculation.qmd`) — data cleaning, continuity corrections, and computation of lnRR, lnVR, and lnCVR

- **Overall effects** (`overall_effect.qmd`) — intercept-only multilevel models for each effect size

- **Uni-moderators** (`uni_moderators.qmd`) — uni-moderator meta-regressions and post-hoc contrasts

- **Publication bias** (`publication_bias.qmd`) — small-study effects / bias diagnostics

- **Leave-one-out** (`leave_one_out.qmd`) — sensitivity analyses excluding one study at a time

- **Main figures** (`main_figures.qmd`) — reproduction of figures from the manuscript

- **Alluvial** (`Alluvial.qmd`) — alluvial visualization of study characteristics and outcome structure

## Reproducibility

All code is executed in Quarto and frozen for stable rendering.
Where relevant, we provide intermediate outputs (effect-size tables, continuity-correction audits, VCV matrices, model summaries, and contrasts) alongside the exact R code used to generate them.
