## What this site contains

This online supplement provides the complete computational workflow for the systematic review and multilevel meta-analysis of music exposure effects on anxiety- and depression-like behavior in laboratory rodents.

It includes:

- Full data-processing and effect size derivations (**lnRR** and **lnVR**)
- Multilevel model specifications, moderator analyses, and contrasts
- Publication-bias diagnostics and leave-one-out sensitivity analyses
- Figures and downloadable tables

## How to navigate

Use the left sidebar to browse chapters by effect size type (**lnRR** and **lnVR**).  
Use the search box to find code chunks, model objects, or specific moderators (e.g., `Assay_type`, `Meta_genre`).

## Reproducibility

All code is executed in Quarto and frozen for stable rendering.  
Where relevant, we provide intermediate outputs (effect size tables, VCV construction, model summaries) alongside the exact R code used.
