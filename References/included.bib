   abstract = {Background: Fluoxetine is one of the medications used for the treatment of depression with several benefits, but some patients have a poor response to the drug. Several studies reported the use of Mozart music (K448) as an alternative therapy for treating the condition, yet the combination of Mozart and fluoxetine remains underexplored. In light of this, this study aims to assess the impact of combined fluoxetine and Mozart (K448) therapy on depressive-like behavior and associated hormonal changes in a rodent model subjected to Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS) conditions. Materials and Methods: The depression-induced animal model received one of these three specified treatments: fluoxetine (F), Mozart (M), or a combination of fluoxetine and Mozart (F+M). The depressive-like behavior was assessed using a 24-hour sucrose preference test (SPT). Additionally, after 21 days of treatment, plasma corticosterone levels and hippocampal melatonin levels were assessed. Statistical analysis using either ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests was then performed. Results: The fluoxetine-Mozart group had higher SPT compared to CUMS group. However, they do not have a better result compared to other groups in terms of corticosterone and melatonin levels with values of respectively. Conclusion: The combined therapy of fluoxetine and Mozart improved depressive-like behavior.},

   abstract = {<p>Music exposure is known to play a positive role in learning and memory and can be a complementary treatment for anxiety and fear. However, whether juvenile music exposure affects adult behavior is not known. Two-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to music for 2 hours daily or to background noise (controls) for a period of 3 weeks. At 60 days of age, rats were subjected to auditory fear conditioning, fear extinction training, and anxiety-like behavior assessments or to anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) assays. We found that the music-exposed rats showed significantly less freezing behaviors during fear extinction training and spent more time in the open arm of the elevated plus maze after fear conditioning when compared with the control rats. Moreover, the BDNF levels in the ACC in the music group were significantly higher than those of the controls with the fear conditioning session. This result suggests that music exposure in juvenile rats decreases anxiety-like behaviors, facilitates fear extinction, and increases BDNF levels in the ACC in adulthood after a stressful event.</p>},

   abstract = {Music has been proposed for a long time as a treatment for mental disorders. However, some special types of music or stimulating sounds might induce negative emotions. Herein, 8-week-old male mice were exposed to two specific genres of music, Hip-Hop (HH) and Heavy Metal (HM) and Construction Noise (CN) and a series of behavioral experiments were performed to evaluate the impact of these music or sounds on the emotion of mice. The experiment lasted 1 week in which 8-week-old male mice were used as animal models. We found that long term exposure HM, HH and CN induced depressive symptoms with a decrease in dopamine receptor 1 and BDNF protein in the mixture of hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice. Our results have highly addressed that certain special types of sound or music might induce negative emotions and loss of dopaminergic neurons in mice and it is necessary to intervene in adolescences that are exposed to these music or sounds for a long time. Research Article different musical composition will have the exact opposite effects on a human's emotional state. Hip-hop music and heavy metal music are two controversial types of music that appeal to teenagers more than other age groups [9]. Studies show a general correlation between antisocial behaviors and listening to rap, which includes hip-hop and heavy metal music [10]. Rap music including hip-hop is found to be associated with deviant behaviors (violence, theft, street gangs, mild drug use and hard drug use) in adolescents [11]. Relationship is found between heavy metal music and depression, delinquency, risk-taking and drug-taking behaviors, suicidal thinking and deliberate self-harm, despite that the underlying mechanisms is unknown due to influences of other factors such as family situations [12-14]. Indeed, heavy metal's usual hopeless theme might be the main cause of it usually becoming the victim to be blamed for teenager's psychological health [12]. Still, other studies claim that the miserable themes prevalent in heavy metal music provide an emotional outlet for adolescents, improving their well-being and fans of heavy metal exhibit no anxiety-like or depressive behaviors [15].},

The animals were divided into four groups: control group (CG), cocoa powder group (CPG), music group (MG) and cocoa powder with music group (CPMG). During 15 days, CPG and CPMG received commercial non-alkalized cocoa powder daily (66 mg total polyphenols / g of product, by oral gavage), while MG and CPMG were exposed to the music of Mozart (Serenade N.10 in B flat major for woodwinds and bass, "Gran partita" K.361 / 370a, Largo movement, 8:35 minutes long). At the end of the experiment, the animals were submitted to elevated plus-maze (EPM) and open-field (OF) tests, and serum analysis of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances index (TBA-RS) and the activity of antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismu-tase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Animals from MG and CPMG groups showed the highest total horizontal locomotion and more time spent at the central area and reduced immobility time at the OF. The TBA-RS average of the treated groups were lower than the GC. The average activity of CAT was higher in CPMG than the others, and the average activity of SOD and GSH-Px were higher only in CPG and CPMG. We concluded that the treatment with this classical music showed mild anxiolytic activity. Both treatments (cocoa and music) improved serum antioxidant status, but the peripheral activity of different serum enzymes was mainly improved by the cocoa powder.},

   abstract = {<p>Several interventions have been shown to counteract the effects of stress that may be related to improved neuroplasticity and neuronal activation. In this sense, environmental enrichment (ENR) protects against acute stress and increases neuroplasticity. It has been suggested that the use of patterned auditory stimuli (PAS) may be beneficial in increasing the effectiveness of ENR on disorders related to stress, such as depression and anxiety. Examples of PAS are classical music compositions that have interesting effects at both clinical and preclinical levels. Thus, we analyzed the effects of the exposure to PAS, represented in this study by Mozart’s compositions, during ENR housing for 35 days in adult male Balb/C mice to evaluate depression-associated behavior using the forced-swim test (FST) paradigm with an additional short exposure to PAS. We found that the ENR mice that were exposed to PAS during both housing and behavioral task (ENR + PAS/FST + PAS) show decreased immobility and the number of despair episodes within a higher latency to show the first bout of immobility. Additionally, we found increased neuronal activation evaluated by the identification of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein- (Arc-) labeled cells in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in mice exposed to PAS during housing and in the absence or presence of PAS during FST. Moreover, we found increased neuronal activation in the auditory cortex (AuCx) of mice exposed to PAS during FST. Our study suggests that the exposure to PAS during an emotional challenge decreases despair-like behavior in rodents that were previously housed in an enriched environment in combination with auditory stimuli. Thus, our data indicate that the role of the exposure to PAS as an intervention or in combination with positive environment to aid in treating neuropsychiatric disorders is worth pursuing.</p>},

   abstract = {Depression, a pervasive mental health issue, often necessitates innovative therapeutic interventions. This study explores the efficacy of music therapy, a non-pharmacological approach, in ameliorating depression symptoms in a murine model. Employing a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model to induce depressionlike behaviors in mice, we investigated the therapeutic potential of four distinct music genres: light, classical, atonal composition, and rock music. Behavioral assessments, including sucrose preference and immobility time, were conducted to evaluate the impact of music therapy. Additionally, we measured the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptic proteins and neurogenesis to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms. Our findings indicated that light and classical music significantly alleviated depression-like behaviors in mice, evidenced by increased sucrose preference and reduced immobility time. Conversely, atonal composition and rock music did not yield similar therapeutic benefits. Biochemically, light and classical music were associated with decreased levels of corticosterone and increased levels of glucocorticoid receptor, alongside enhanced BDNF signaling, synaptic proteins and neurogenesis. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that specific genres of music, notably light and classical music, may contribute to alleviating depression-like symptoms, potentially through mechanisms associated with BDNF signaling and neurogenesis. These results highlight the potential of targeted music therapy as a complementary approach in treating depression, with implications for its incorporation into broader therapeutic regimes. Further re-search is warranted to translate these findings into clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Little is known about combined effects of environmental enrichment and music stimulation on mice spatial learning and memory and on its innate repertoire to avoid open spaces. To investigate this question, 3 months aged BALB/c mice subjected to an environmental enriched (EE) or to an impoverished standard laboratory cage (IE) were exposed to random classical music (CM), three times a week, 12 h/day, three months, during the dark cycle, with an intensity of 65 dB. These groups were compared to control maintained in IE or EE but not exposed to music. All mice were then tested at the elevated plus maze (EPM), open field (OF) and Morris water maze (MWM). All tests were video recorded and analyzed using the Any-Maze®. A contrast index measured the relationship between the time spent in the periphery and the center of the open arena and between the closed and open arms of the EPM, and two-way ANOVA of these indices, showed significant influence of environment and music on the natural tendency to avoid open spaces. Of interest, was the significant increase in the time spent in the EPM closed arms of the EE/CM. All mice learned how to find and recall the hidden platform position before 7 days training. However, music stimulated EE mice, learned and recall the platform location faster than all other groups. In the open field test, it was found that the sound stimulus did not affect the locomotor behavior of these animals. Thus, the combination of an enriched environment and classical music stimulation seems to interact and enhance spatial learning and memory and increase the natural tendencies of BALB/c young mice to avoid open spaces.},

While some studies report beneficial effects of musical listening and practice on cognitive aging, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain unknown. This study aims to determine whether chronic (6 h/day, 3 times/week) and long-lasting (4–8 months) music exposure, initiated at middle age in rats (15 months old), can influence behavioral parameters sensitive to age effects and reduce age-related spatial memory decline in rats. Spontaneous locomotor, circadian rhythmic activity, and anxiety-like behavior as well as spatial working and reference memory were assessed in 14-month-old rats and then after 4 and 8 months of music exposure (19 and 23 months old, respectively). Spatial learning and reference memory data were followed up by considering cognitive status of animals prior to music exposure (14 months old) given by K-means clustering of individual Z-score. Hippocampal cell proliferation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level in the hippocampus and frontal cortex were measured. Results show that music exposure differentially rescues age-related deficits in spatial navigation tasks according to its duration without affecting spontaneous locomotor, circadian rhythmic activity, and anxiety-like behavior. Hippocampal cell proliferation as well as hippocampal and frontal cortex BDNF levels was not affected by music across aging. Cognitive improvement by music in aging rats may require distinct neurobiological mechanisms than hippocampal cell proliferation and BDNF.</p>},

   abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been reported to play important roles in the modulation of anxiety, mood stabilizers, and pathophysiology of affective disorders. Recently, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the BDNF gene (Val66Met) has been found to be associated with depression and anxiety disorders. The humanized BDNFMet/Met knock-in transgenic mice exhibited increased anxiety-related behaviors that were unresponsive to serotonin reuptake inhibitors, fluoxetine. Music is known to be able to elicit emotional changes, including anxiolytic effects. In this study, we found that music treatment could significantly decrease anxiety state in BDNFMet/Met mice, but not in BDNF+/-, mice compared with white noise exposure in open field and elevated plus maze test. Moreover, in contrast to white noise exposure, BDNF expression levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala and hippocampus were significantly increased in music-exposed adult BDNFMet/Met mice. However, music treatment could not upregulate BDNF levels in the PFC, amygdala, and hippocampus in BDNF +/- mice, which suggests the essential role of BDNF in the anxiolytic effect of music. Together, our results imply that music may provide an effective therapeutic intervention for anxiety disorders in humans with this genetic BDNFMet variant. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To further understand the mechanisms of action, we exposed rats to classical music for 1 month, and then treated them orally with simvastatin. The behavioral experiments suggested that exposure to subchronic simvastatin (1 or 10 mg/kg/day) reduced anxiety levels in the elevated plus-maze and open-field test in rats exposed to Mozart music. The recognition object test results indicated that simvastatin altered non-spatial working memory only at the 1 mg/kg/day dose and improved both short and long-term object recognition. No significant differences were found between Mozart music and silence in the object recognition test, suggesting that music did not significant affect learning and memory in adult rats. We hypothesize that the anxiolytic, but not object recognition memory, effects of simvastatin and classical music effects occur through similar mechanisms, providing an important foundation for future preclinical and clinical research.},

   abstract = {Stress is a reaction to possibly threatening stimuli. Chronic stress leads to oxidative stress and damage to the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, leading to anxiety disorders, depression, changes in synaptic plasticity, decreased neurogenesis, increased neurodegeneration, and impaired learning and memory. Music triggers emotional and cognitive aspects that help improve cognitive functions. Music therapy reduces anxiety, improves mood, and generates calming effects. The effect of Mohana Raga on human mental health is an interesting area of study, as Indian classical music, particularly ragas, is believed to have therapeutic potential. While there is limited specific research on Mohana Raga alone, there are studies and scholarly works that explore the general effects of Indian ragas, including Mohana, on mental health, emotional well-being, and psychological states. Also, listening to the raga Bhupali (Mohana) improved learning and memory. Animals were exposed to a chronic, unpredictable mild stress protocol for 28 days, followed by exposure to Indian classical music for 1 hour for 21 days, starting from the last week of the stress protocol. Post-treatment, the animals were subjected to an elevated plus maze, sucrose preference test, forced swim test, novel object recognition test, and T-maze alteration task for behavioural analysis. Animals exposed to chronic, unpredictable mild stress showed increased anxiety-like behaviour, anhedonia, behavioural despair, and impaired recognition and working memory. Remarkably, in stressed animals exposed to Indian classical music for one hour per day for 3 weeks, there was a complete recovery in anxiety, depression, and memory. In conclusion, our study posits that a short duration of music exposure is beneficial for chronic stress conditions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, the underlying mechanisms through which musical enrichment exerts its effects are poorly understood. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were submitted to a 3 h MS protocol during postnatal days (PND) 2–14, while another group was left undisturbed. Half of the animals within each group were exposed from PND 21 to PND 76 for 12 h/day to Mozart K. 448. At approximately three months of age, elevated plus maze procedure, forced swim test and social approach task were applied to test whether music exposure can mitigate the effects of MS stress on animal emotional behaviors. Moreover, we investigated the effects of these treatments on dendritic spine density in the CA1 region of hippocampus. As expected, MS rats showed decreased sociability, increased anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, and decreased mature dendritic spines in the CA1 region of hippocampus in adulthood. Musical enrichment reversed these effects. Our results suggest that musical enrichment can reverse the negative effects of MS on anxiety, depression, and sociability in adult rats and modulate neuronal plasticity and provide additional data for a new therapeutic intervention to rescue emotional symptoms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {<p>Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric disorder worldwide and remains incurable; however, there is little research on its prevention. The leading cause of depression is stress, and music has been hypothesized to alleviate stress. To examine the potential beneficial effects of music on stress and depression, we subjected mice to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) during the day and music at night. Strikingly, our results indicated that music completely prevented CUMS-induced depression and anxiety-like behaviors in mice, as assessed by the open field, tail suspension, sucrose preference, novelty suppressed feeding, and elevated plus maze tests. We found that listening to music restored serum corticosterone levels in CUMS mice, which may contribute to the beneficial effects of music on the mouse brain, including the restoration of BDNF and Bcl-2 levels. Furthermore, listening to music prevented CUMS-induced oxidative stress in the serum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus of mice. Moreover, the CUMS-induced inflammatory responses in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of mice were prevented by listening to music. Taken together, we have demonstrated for the first time in mice experiments that listening to music prevents stress-induced depression and anxiety-like behaviors in mice. Music may restore hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis homeostasis, preventing oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurotrophic factor deficits, which had led to the observed phenotypes in CUMS mice.</p>},

   abstract = {Music is known to be able to elicit emotional changes, including anxiolytic effects. The gonadal steroid hormones estradiol and progesterone have also been reported to play important roles in the modulation of anxiety. In the present study, we examined whether the effect of music on anxiety is related to ovarian steroid in female mice. Behavioral paradigms measuring anxiety were tested in gonadally intact (SHAM) and ovariectomized (OVX) female mice chronically treated with either placebo (OVX/Placebo), 17 beta-estradiol (OVX/E), or progesterone (OVX/P). In the elevated plus maze, light-dark transition, and marble burying tests, SHAM and OVX/P mice exposed to music showed less anxiety than those exposed to white noise or silence while OVX/placebo mice did not show these effects at all. OVX/E mice showed the anxiolytic effect of music only in the marble burying test. Furthermore, pretreatment with progesterone's metabolite inhibitor completely prevented the anxiolytic effect of music in behavioral tests, while pretreatment with a progesterone receptor blocker did not prevent the anxiolytic effect of music. These results suggest that exposure to music reduces anxiety levels, and ovarian steroids, mainly progesterone, may be involved in the anxiolytic effect of music observed in female mice.

   abstract = {This research was conducted to investigate the influence of music therapy on the behavior of rats at different stages of development. The procedures were performed when animals were approximately 1 month of age, and repeated once they completed 2, 3, and 4 months. Mozart’s Sonata for Two Pianos was played at a sound intensity of 65 dB for 4 hours per day, 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the afternoon (12 hours, for 4 days) when the animals reached each age. In the Open Field test, the locomotion in rats with 4 months old was significantly less than in other ages. Female rats 1, 2, and 3 months old, which were exposed to music, increased the percentage of open arms time in the Elevated Plus Maze test while male rats 1 month old reduced this parameter. The statistical differences were observed in the Forced Swimming test only when both genders were 1 month old. In the Inhibitory Avoidance test, an improvement in age-dependent memory was observed. The music therapy based on Mozart’s Sonata for Two Pianos positively interfered with the behavior of rats at different developmental stages. This result corroborates the clinical practice of palliative care, in which music therapy is generally used to improve patients’ quality of life with anxiety and depression. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Postpartum depression (PPD) significantly impacts women’s mental health and social functioning, yet effective therapies remain limited. This study investigates the preventive effects of music therapy on PPD-like behaviors and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms in a mouse model subjected to ovarian hormone withdrawal (HW). Mice exposed to daily music sessions exhibited markedly reduced depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, as evidenced by enhanced performance in behavioral tests such as the open field test (OFT), forced swim test (FST), elevated plus maze test (EPM), sucrose preference test (SPT), novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test, and tail suspension test (TST). Furthermore, music therapy normalized oxidative stress indicators (NO, MDA, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, T-AOC, ATP, and glutamate) in the serum, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Additionally, music exposure reduced levels of proinflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, iNOS, TNF-α, and TGF-β) and the activation of microglia and astrocytes in these brain regions. Notably, music therapy preserved neuronal integrity, promoted neurogenesis, and maintained synaptic plasticity, evidenced by the restoration of dendritic spines. Transcriptome sequencing identified differential gene expression in pathways related to synaptic plasticity, inflammation, and oxidative stress. These findings suggest that music therapy prevents PPD by modulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and synaptic integrity, providing robust preclinical evidence for its potential as a natural preventive intervention for PPD. This study underscores the need for further clinical research to validate the therapeutic efficacy of music in preventing PPD in humans, highlighting its promise as a non-invasive and accessible treatment modality. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},
